🔍 Project Overview:
CustomBites allows users to:

 • 🛠️ Customize their orders according to preferences
 • 🛒 Place orders in real-time

Meanwhile, the admin panel empowers the backend with:
 • 👤 User management

🧩 Key Features:
 • Dynamic order customization
 • Real-time database interaction
 • Admin-side CRUD operations
 • Structured and normalized relational database design

🛠️ Tech Stack:
 • Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Bootstrap for responsiveness)
 • Backend: PHP (can be extended with Node.js/Python for flexibility)
 • Database: MySQL
 • Server: Apache (via XAMPP/WAMP)

📊 What I Gained:
✔️ Practical experience in relational database design and normalization
✔️ SQL query development for both frontend and backend interaction
✔️ Frontend-backend integration using PHP and MySQL
✔️ Real-world understanding of how data flows in full-stack web applications
✔️ Implementation of user authentication and order lifecycle

This project solidified my understanding of database-driven systems and gave me a hands-on look into what it takes to build a scalable, real-world application from scratch.
